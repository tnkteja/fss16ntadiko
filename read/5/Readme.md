   5. **Data Sets :**

   The data sets used arebugs submitted for android between november 2007 and septtember 2012. The effective number of bug report after the filter of the improper bug reports is around 37200, out of which the duplicates are only 1063.

   6. **Future Work :**

iv.
  1.  The paper could have considered the source code files associated with bug reports and used them to improve the accuracy.

  2.  Although the training sets were enough for the model, date sets over more time frame would have been improved the accuracy of model prediction.
